Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\\\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 3, 7, 15, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect either \\\\$50 or \\\\$250 or pay the bank \\\\$50.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 0, 10, and 20 do not trigger any action \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**, which sends the player directly to **Jail** and ends the turn \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the player rolls doubles (i.e. the dice have equal values) the player moves from Square 10 a number of squares equal to the sum of the dice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles she pays the bank \\$20 and remains in **Jail** \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player passes or lands on **GO** she collects \\$200. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player lands on any other square not mentioned above, she pays the bank \\$25. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If at any point the player has \\$0 or less they go bankrupt and the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~tonyewong/home/resources/miniopoly_example.png) for an example of the Miniopoly board layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A**: Complete the function miniopoly_turn below. The function should simulate one turn of Miniopoly.  It should take as arguments the player's current location on the board as well as the player's current cash reserves, and return the player's new location and cash reserves after the turn has completed. Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.  "
